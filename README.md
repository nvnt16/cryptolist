## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Ubuntu 16.04 Installation instructions
Run these commands in the order below on a clean Ubuntu installation or Virtual Machine:
```
sudo apt update
```

Install CURL:
```
sudo apt install curl
```

Download NodeJS:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Optional Commands if NodeJS and NPM don't get installed correctly:
```

npm -v
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

Install Truffle node package globally:
```
sudo npm install -g truffle
```

Install git to clone the repository:
```

```

Traverse to the ChanChain repository and install dependencies:
```

If "truffle develop" doesn't work, install truffle again:
```
npm install truffle
```

### Prerequisites
Use the Powershell or CMD on Windows with Administrator privileges and install: windows-build-tools node truffle
```
npm install windows-build-tools

You can also copy the ChanChain.sol contract code and paste it in Remix. After that you can compile and test the contract in the truffle console:
